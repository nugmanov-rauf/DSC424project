```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r data}
data <- read.csv("PitchDataset.csv")
```

```{r expl, eval=FALSE}
library(DataExplorer)
summary(data)
create_report(data,output_file = "pitch_data.html")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
